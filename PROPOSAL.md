Blockchain-based Game
===========
[https://github.com/jweiss0/OSS-Blockchain-Game](https://github.com/jweiss0/OSS-Blockchain-Game)

Overview
--------
This project is a web-based game, built on blockchain technology. 

Ultimately, we plan to use this project as a learning experience for blockchain development. The project is licensed under [GPL v3.0](https://github.com/jweiss0/OSS-Blockchain-Game/blob/main/LICENSE) to ensure it maintains an open source status and can be used by others in the community to learn blockchain development. Much of the project is not set in stone, leaving it up to the developers and community to modify the plans for the project as they see fit.

Semester Plan
-------------
Our goal this semester is to develop a completely functional web-based game, built on the blockchain. Creating a multiplayer game will be a difficult task for a single semester, so we plan to make the game singleplayer. We will concentrate on simple functionality, regarding both smart contracts and the front end web application. We would prefer a working application with simple features over a nonfunctional application with many features. Although the game will be singleplayer, there will be a leaderboard to display scores of different users.

Technology
----------
We will be using **React** with _Redux_ for coding the front end of the application and **Solidity** for coding the smart contracts. Smart contract development, testing, and deployment will be performed with the **Hardhat** environment. We plan to deploy the smart contracts to the **Avalanche** network.
